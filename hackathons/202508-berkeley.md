title: "August 2025 Hackathon & Design Dialog (Berkeley, CA)"
---

:::{attention}
This page is a work in progress! Please check back soon for more details.
:::

We invite you to join a group of **roughly 25** brilliant and friendly developers,
researchers, and educators to develop ideas & software to implement the
[GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org) mission: to enable more researchers, educators, and
learners to confidently interact with geospatial data in Jupyter.

**Our first day will be dedicated to technical development, and our second day will be
dedicated to gathering input from geospatial educators and practitioners.**

**To participate, please contact us (see below) or
[fill out our registration form](https://forms.gle/8GkAyTvSrJ9it9J39)**.


## Location

At the University of California, Berkeley.

_TBD_ -- either in Wellman Hall on campus, or the AI Futures Lab just off-campus.


## Schedule

August 13 & 14, 2025.

We will start at 9AM Pacific Time each day, and finish at 4PM.


### August 13, day 1 - Hackathon

Day 1 will be focused on technical development.
Developers will convene, break into focus areas (see below), and work together to explore
problems, and design and develop solutions.

| Time       | Activity                     |
|------------|-----------------------------:|
| 9:00 AM PT | Meet @ venue                 |
| 9-9:45 AM  | Introductions & icebreaker   |
| 10:30 AM   | Snacks & coffee provided     |
| 12:00 PM   | Lunch provided               |
| 2:30 PM    | Snacks & coffee provided     |
| 4:00 PM    | Done for the day!            |
| 6:00 PM    | Dinner provided              |


#### Focus areas

Focus areas include, but are not limited to:

* Design and development of a reproducible "processing toolbox" for
  [JupyterGIS](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/).
  How do we enable users to run processing operations (for example buffering, finding
  centroids, or generating contours) in the visual GIS environment, and record those
  operations for inclusion in a notebook that can be reproducibly executed from
  top-to-bottom?
* Designing for [JupyterGIS](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/) interoperability with
  other tools in the scientific Python ecosystem.
  For example, how do we move vector data bi-directionally between a GIS project and a
  Python Notebook?
* Solidifying the [JupyterGIS](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/) Python API for
  ergonomics and future evolution?

If you have more ideas for hackathon focus areas, please contact us (see below)!


### August 14, day 2 - Design Dialog

Day 2 will be focused on use case & user experience development.
Practitioners, educators, and developers will convene, identify areas of interest
together, and break in to interest groups.

**For developers who want to continue hacking on work from day 1, space will be provided.**
