A session proposed by the GeoJupyter community has been accepted for AGU 2025 as
[IN029](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/prelim.cgi/Session/252486):

> **Open Source Geospatial Workflows in the Cloud: Tools and Techniques for Data Access,
> Analysis, Visualization, Storytelling, and Sharing in the Python and Jupyter
> ecosystem**
>
> Open and fluid interoperability is increasingly crucial as geospatial data, from Earth
> system models to in-situ and remote observations, grow in size and complexity. This
> interoperability is both more challenging and impactful when workflows combine local
> and cloud platform resources. A growing ecosystem of science, education, and industry
> is emerging that shares open source tools and standards to democratize and facilitate
> access to data and compute. This session invites practitioners and developers
> exploring approaches to improve accessibility, usability, and capabilities of open
> source geospatial software, focusing on lowering technical barriers. By acknowledging
> both strengths and limitations of available tools, we aim to facilitate open
> conversations about what's working, what's missing, and what's next. We seek to
> convene tool builders and users to chart a more inclusive, community-driven path
> forward for open geospatial science, fostering better understanding of our world
> through enhanced access to data and computational resources.

We're excited to hear what you have to say at our session!

**Fernando PÃ©rez** is an Associate Professor in Statistics at UC Berkeley and scientist
at LBNL. He builds open source tools for humans to use computers as companions in
thinking and collaboration, mostly in the scientific Python ecosystem (IPython, Jupyter
& friends).

A computational physicist by training, his research interests include
questions at the nexus of software and geoscience, seeking to build the computational
and data ecosystem to tackle problems like climate change with collaborative, open,
reproducible, and extensible scientific practices.

He is a co-founder of Project Jupyter, the 2i2c.org initiative, the Berkeley Institute
for Data Science, and the NumFOCUS Foundation. He is a recipient of the 2017 ACM
Software System Award and the 2012 FSF Award for the Advancement of Free Software.
In 2024, Project Jupyter was
[honored by the Biden White House as a winner of the Year of Open Science Recognition challenge](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/03/21/white-house-office-of-science-technology-policy-announces-year-of-open-science-recognition-challenge-winners/).

**Dr. Qiusheng Wu** is an Associate Professor and the Director of Graduate Studies in the
Department of Geography & Sustainability at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He
also serves as an Amazon Scholar. Dr. Wuâ€™s research focuses on geospatial data science
and open-source software development, with an emphasis on leveraging big geospatial data
and cloud computing to study environmental change, particularly surface water and
wetland inundation dynamics. He is the creator of several widely used open-source Python
packages, including geemap, leafmap, segment-geospatial, and geoai, which support
advanced geospatial analysis and interactive visualization.

His open-source work is available at [\@opengeos](https://github.com/opengeos).

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Community Manager and Research Software Engineer at
[Schmidt Center for Data Science & Environment](https://dse.berkeley.edu/) at UC
Berkeley.
I'm passionate about open source software, open science, and building culture and
structure to help people feel safe and comfortable contributing to scientific software
projects.

My primary project is [GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org/), a community that strives to
enable more people to confidently engage with geospatial data in the Jupyter ecosystem.
Our flagship project, bootstrapped by [QuantStack](https://quantstack.net/), is
[JupyterGIS](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/): a JupyterLab-native GIS environment
with real-time collaboration.

You can find more information about me at [my website](https://mfisher87.github.io/)!
