A session proposed by the GeoJupyter community has been accepted for AGU 2025 as
[IN029](https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu25/prelim.cgi/Session/252486):

> **Open Source Geospatial Workflows in the Cloud: Tools and Techniques for Data Access,
> Analysis, Visualization, Storytelling, and Sharing in the Python and Jupyter
> ecosystem**
>
> Open and fluid interoperability is increasingly crucial as geospatial data, from Earth
> system models to in-situ and remote observations, grow in size and complexity. This
> interoperability is both more challenging and impactful when workflows combine local
> and cloud platform resources. A growing ecosystem of science, education, and industry
> is emerging that shares open source tools and standards to democratize and facilitate
> access to data and compute. This session invites practitioners and developers
> exploring approaches to improve accessibility, usability, and capabilities of open
> source geospatial software, focusing on lowering technical barriers. By acknowledging
> both strengths and limitations of available tools, we aim to facilitate open
> conversations about what's working, what's missing, and what's next. We seek to
> convene tool builders and users to chart a more inclusive, community-driven path
> forward for open geospatial science, fostering better understanding of our world
> through enhanced access to data and computational resources.

We're excited to hear what you have to say at our session!

**Dr. Qiusheng Wu** is an Associate Professor and the Director of Graduate Studies in the
Department of Geography & Sustainability at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He
also serves as an Amazon Scholar. Dr. Wuâ€™s research focuses on geospatial data science
and open-source software development, with an emphasis on leveraging big geospatial data
and cloud computing to study environmental change, particularly surface water and
wetland inundation dynamics. He is the creator of several widely used open-source Python
packages, including geemap, leafmap, segment-geospatial, and geoai, which support
advanced geospatial analysis and interactive visualization.

His open-source work is available at [\@opengeos](https://github.com/opengeos).

**Dr. Tyler Erickson** is the founder of the geospatial consultancy VorGeo, a Technical
Fellow at the non-profit Radiant Earth, and a founding editorial board member of the
Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum. Previously he led the developer relations team for Google
Earth Engine. Dr. Erickson's work focuses on building communities & ecosystems around
emerging technologies, with an emphasis on technologies that can be leveraged by
environmental sustainability projects.

ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Community Manager and Research Software Engineer at
[Schmidt Center for Data Science & Environment](https://dse.berkeley.edu/) at UC
Berkeley.
I'm passionate about open source software, open science, and building culture and
structure to help people feel safe and comfortable contributint to scientific software
projects.

My primary project is [GeoJupyter](https://geojupyter.org/), a community that strives to
enable more people to confidently engage with geospatial data in the Jupyter ecosystem.
Our flagship project, bootstrapped by [QuantStack](https://quantstack.net/), is
[JupyterGIS](https://jupytergis.readthedocs.io/): a JupyterLab-native GIS environment
with real-time collaboration.

You can find more information about me at [my website](https://mfisher87.github.io/)!
